# game03
this project is for development of a small working good program that will help me make my game that i want and this is  a prototype for it and i have kept stuff modular and most stuff from here can be reused though not that great i am new at this i will appreiciate any improvement suggestion for it and new game mechanic ideas as well - good day 

## changes

there is gonna be a huge rehaul to structure and code i thought doing engine and game separate with modularity good but it kinda getting confusing
so here is the thing i am gonna completely make a game i wont try modular i wanted modular so i could like distribute it to people as a template but its a pain
